sshutils-go
===========

ssh utilities for go

'Standard-ish' implementations for:

 * 'Known hosts' file checker, and TODO: adding keys
 * Typical client-auth implementations for password, keyring, and ssh-agent
 

See also:

 * [scp-go](https://github.com/laher/scp-go/) uses sshutils-go for authentication and known-hosts checking.
 * [someutils](https://github.com/laher/someutils/) bundles scp-go as `scp` or `some scp`.
